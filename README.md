# AIDA-data

This repository contains code for downloading and preprocessing datasets
used across software project of the [AIDA Lab](https://aidalabdei.github.io/)
at the Department of Information Engineering of the University of Padova.

## Usage

<details>
<summary>Dense datasets.</summary>

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

from aida_data.dense import SafeL2Normalizer, load

# Raw (cleaned) data
distance, train = load("glove-100-angular")

# Preprocess with any sklearn transformer/pipeline: it is fitted on the
# train set and applied to the test set.
pipeline = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(with_std=False), PCA(64), SafeL2Normalizer())
distance, train, test, distances = load("glove-100-angular", pipeline, load_queries=True)
print(pipeline.named_steps["pca"].explained_variance_ratio_)
```
